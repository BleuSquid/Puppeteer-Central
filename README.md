# Puppeteer-Central
The server infrastructure to my RimWorld mod Puppeteer

This projects aims to create a collaborative platform for Mod authors of the game [RimWorld](https://rimworldgame.com). It creates a server that connects the Mod [Puppeteer](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2057192142) to web browsers of viewers watching streamers playing the game RimWorld on Twitch.

Possible thanks to the hosting support by the great guys at [openNode](https://www.openode.io)!
