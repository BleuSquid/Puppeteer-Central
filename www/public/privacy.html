					</ul>
				</p>
			</p>
			<p>
				<h2>What information do we share?</h2>
				<p>We may process your data if you have given us specific consent to use your personal information in a specific purpose.</p>
				<p>We may process your data when it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests.</p>
				<p>Where we have entered into a contract with you, we may process your personal information to fulfill the terms of our contract.</p>
				<p>We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).</p>
				<p>We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</p>
				<p>We may share your data with third party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. Examples include: payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, customer service and marketing efforts. We may allow selected third parties to use tracking technology on the Services, which will enable them to collect data about how you interact with the Services over time.

Unless described in this Policy, we do not share, sell, rent or trade any of your information with third parties for their promotional purposes.</p>

			<p>
				<h2>Do we use Cookies?</h2>
				<p>We use cookies to access your basic identity and to keep your login state in your browser instead of storing it in a database. We do not share that information.</p>
			</p>
			<p>
				<h2>How do we handle your social logins?</h2>
				<p>Our Services offer you the ability to register and login using your third party social media account details (like your Twitch or Google logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile Information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, e-mail address, friends list, profile picture as well as other information you choose to make public.</p>

				<h2>How long do we keep your information?</h2>
				<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 90 days.</p>
				<p>en we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
			</p>
			<p>
				<h2>How do we keep your information safe?</h2>
				<p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure.
