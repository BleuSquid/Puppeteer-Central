			<h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
			<p>
				These Terms of Service reflect the way our business works, the laws that apply to our company, and certain things we’ve always believed to be
				true. As a result, these Terms of Service help define our relationship with you as you interact with our services.
			</p>

				<h2>Age requirements</h2>
				<p>If you’re under the age required to manage your own Twitch or Google Account, you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use such an Account. Please have your parent or legal guardian read these terms with you.</p>
				<p>If you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the services, then these terms apply to you and you’re responsible for your child’s activity on the services.</p>
				<p>Some Twitch and Google services have additional age requirements as described in their service-specific additional terms and policies.</p>

				<h2>What you can expect from Puppeteer</h2>
				<p>We use the Twitch and/or YouTube API responsibly and transparently. We do not fetch anything more than the public available thumbnail of your active Live stream and we do not store sensitive login information beyond your profile name, google user id and avatar link.</p>
				<p>We will use your Twitch/YouTube identity to allow others to communicate safely and with verified identities - nothing more.</p>
			</p>
			<p>
				<h2>What we expect from you</h2>
				<p>We want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone, which means you must follow these basic rules of conduct:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions, and human trafficking laws</li>
					<li>respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights</li>
					<li>don’t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) — for example, by misleading, defrauding, defaming, bullying, harassing, or stalking others</li>
					<li>don’t abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt the services</li>
				</ul>
